This goes for the design and UX as well as how well the app solves a problem for the user e.g. being entertaining, useful or providing relevant content. As the user's expertise in apps grows, they also expect more from the apps they use and compare them to existing, well-established ones. Enterprise apps will also benefit from being awesome in order to stand out and make a strong connection with the user. If you have an idea for a mobile game and are looking forward to get it developed from a reliable custom mobile game development company, Contact us.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBoris Zarco(Project Founder)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you want to contact us you can use this handy form Google, we will reply as soon as possible.\r\nCONTACT FORM: \r\n`<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1BHjt4FsyXHWh533kL_me5oCLPLCx5FL8x9WZxURNtyODyA/viewform?embedded=true\" width=\"760\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Caricamento in corso...</iframe>`",
